ES6 classes
=

Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: classexpressions and class declarations.

      class Rectangle {
        constructor(height, width) {
         this.height = height;
         this.width = width;
        }
       }

Class expressions
=
A class expression is another way to define a class. Class expressions can be named or unnamed. The name given to a named class expression is local to the class's body. However, it can be accessed via the name property.
